# Lyric Distribution Fix Summary

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: In measure 29 of "Crossing The Bar," the Soprano part sings "far" on a dotted-half note, but other voices have different slur patterns and note durations. The previous strict matching rule (exact offset + exact duration) failed to copy this lyric to other voices, resulting in dropped lyrics.

## Solution Implemented

### New Deterministic Time-Window Matching Algorithm

Replaced the overly strict exact matching approach with a musically intelligent time-window system:

**Old Algorithm** (Failed):
```python
# Required EXACT offset AND duration match
if (abs(note.offset - source_offset) < precision and 
    abs(note.duration - source_duration) < precision):
    # Copy lyric
```

**New Algorithm** (Success):
```python
# Find notes that START during source note's time window
if source_start <= note.offset < source_end:
    # Apply musical intelligence rules
    # Select best candidate using deterministic precedence
```

### Key Features

1. **Time-Window Matching**: Notes are candidates if they start during the source note's duration
2. **Slur Awareness**: Respects slurs, only placing lyrics on slur starts (not middle/end)
3. **Deterministic Selection**: Clear precedence rules (longest duration → earliest timing → consistent ordering)
4. **Musical Intelligence**: Designed specifically for choral music where every note matters

## Results

### Before Fix (Measure 29)
- **Soprano**: "far" ✅ (dotted half note)
- **Alto**: ❌ (dropped - different duration)
- **Tenor**: ❌ (dropped - different duration) 
- **Bass**: ❌ (dropped - different duration)

### After Fix (Measure 29)
- **Soprano**: "far" ✅ (dotted half note - 3.0 duration)
- **Alto**: "far" ✅ (half note - 2.0 duration)
- **Tenor**: "far" ✅ (quarter note - 1.0 duration)
- **Bass**: "far" ✅ (half note - 2.0 duration)

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- [`satb_splitter/contextual_unifier.py`](satb_splitter/contextual_unifier.py): Core algorithm implementation
- [`tests/conftest.py`](tests/conftest.py): Fixed pytest session warning issue

### New Methods Added
```python
def _find_candidates_in_time_window(self, note_info, target_measure)
def _filter_slurred_notes(self, candidates, measure)
def _is_note_in_slur_middle(self, note, measure)
def _select_best_lyric_candidate(self, candidates)
```

### Tests Created
- [`tests/test_lyric_distribution_fix.py`](tests/test_lyric_distribution_fix.py): Comprehensive test suite
- [`scripts/demo_lyric_fix.py`](scripts/demo_lyric_fix.py): Demonstration script

## Design Principles

1. **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same output
2. **Choral-Focused**: Optimized for vocal music where every note is sung
3. **Transparent**: Clear rules that are easy to understand and debug
4. **Musically Aware**: Respects phrase structure, slurs, and rhythmic hierarchy

## Validation

### Test Results
- ✅ All new tests pass (5/5)
- ✅ All existing lyric tests pass (9/9)
- ✅ All basic functionality tests pass (13/13)
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

### Demo Output
```
✅ SUCCESS: 'far' lyric found in 4 voices: Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass
   The time-window matching algorithm successfully distributed the lyric!
```

## Technical Architecture

The solution follows the architecture documented in [`design_v2/lyric_distribution_architecture.md`](design_v2/lyric_distribution_architecture.md), implementing:

- **Flexible Time Windows**: Captures notes that start during source duration
- **Musical Context Awareness**: Handles slurs, phrase boundaries, rhythmic patterns
- **Deterministic Selection**: Consistent, predictable behavior
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of edge cases

## Impact

This fix resolves the core issue where musically appropriate lyrics were being dropped due to overly strict technical matching criteria. The new algorithm maintains musical accuracy while being much more flexible in handling the natural rhythmic variations found in choral music.

The solution is both backward-compatible and forward-looking, providing a solid foundation for handling complex lyric distribution scenarios in SATB voice splitting.
